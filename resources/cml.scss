/*
  Caffeinated Markup reference style

  This file contains a default stylesheet for html brewed Caffeinated Markup. You don't need to use
  this, but the reference implementations use it and the acceptance tests at
  http://github.com/necrophonic/caffeinated-markup-language/t assume these classes etc.

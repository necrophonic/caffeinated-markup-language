		<h1>Caffeinated Markup</h1>

		<p>
		The <em>Caffeinated Markup Language</em> is an attempt to create a simple yet rich
		markup language for easy posting of awesome blog posts and articles that can then
		be published into a variety of formats.
		</p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>
		There are a lot of markup languages out there (HTML, Markdown, LaTEX etc) and they
		all have strengths and weaknesses. <em>Caffeinated Markup</em> doesn't attempt to
		replace any of these but provide another option building on the strengths found in
		other languages.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Example</h2>
		
		<code><pre>
# Caffeinated Markup is awesome
If you're looking for a **simple** yet **powerful** way to //markup// text
whilst leaving it relatively uncluttered with markup furniture, then
//Caffeinated Markup// is the choice for you!

""Caffeinated Markup makes me happy!|Happy Dude""
		</pre></code>

		<p>
		Output is dependant on the formatter implementation, but in <em>HTML</em> and
		<em>plain text</em> the output may look like:
		</p>

		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<code><pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Caffeinated Markup is awesome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're looking for a &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; yet &lt;strong&gt;powerful&lt;/strong&gt; way to
&lt;em&gt;markup&lt;/em&gt; text whilst leaving it relatively uncluttered with markup furniture, then
&lt;em&gt;Caffeinated Markup&lt;/em&gt; is the choice for you!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Caffeinated Markup makes me happy!
&lt;cite&gt;Happy Dude""&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		</pre></code>

		<h3>Plain Text</h3>
		<code><pre>
Caffeinated Markup is awesome
